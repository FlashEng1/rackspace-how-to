### Multiple **Sent**, **Junk**, or **Deleted** folders in Apple Mail

If you have noticed that there are multiple versions of similar folders, and that messages end up in a different folders sometimes you may have unmapped folders.

This issue can be frustrating as it causes a mailbox to become disorganized. It is import that your folders are mapped properly but you must follow these
steps carefully before doing so.

We will start with **Sent**

1. Determine if there is more that one folder prefixed with the word "Sent". If there is take inventory of all of the content of all of theses folders. 
Log into apps.rackspace.com and confirm that the data is also stored there.

2. Move all of the messages from any additional "Sent" folder into the primary "Sent" folder.
